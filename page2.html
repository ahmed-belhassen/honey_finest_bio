An extremely clear straw-coloured honey, with a pleasantly sweet, light tasty aroma – notably loved by children! Ranked highly among the most valued types of honey, this variety holds properties which help with insomnia, treats and calms an over stimulated nervous system and equally eliminates the effects of accumulated stress.

Locust honey is particularly recommended for children and those recovering from illness. For months on end it remains as a liquid state and crystallizes very slowly and can be blended with various other types – so naturally, a popular choice among cooks and chefs. An ideal match with salty cheese, a piece of crusty bread and a glass of red wine!
